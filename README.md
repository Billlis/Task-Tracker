# Task Manager

This is a simple command-line task management tool that allows you to add, update, delete, and list tasks. Each task has a status (e.g., "todo", "in-progress", "done") and a timestamp indicating when it was created and last updated. The tasks are stored in a JSON file (`tasks.json`).

## Features

- **Add a task:** Add a new task to the task list.
- **List tasks:** View tasks by status or all tasks at once.
- **Update a task:** Change the description of a task.
- **Delete a task:** Remove a task by its ID.
- **Mark a task as in-progress:** Change a task's status to "in-progress".
- **Mark a task as done:** Change a task's status to "done".
- **Persistence:** Tasks are stored in a JSON file (`tasks.json`), which is automatically created if it doesn't exist.
